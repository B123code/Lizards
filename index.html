    <h2 id="text1" > Catching, studying, and researching lizards is one of my favorite hobbies! Lizards can show intresting behavior, such as, flashing their dewlaps (a flap of skin under the neck, that is used to attract female anoles or make themselves look more intimidating when defending their teritory). The image above features a Green Anole, which can be found in the Southeastern United States. </h2>

    <h2 id="text3" > The frilled neck lizard, native to Austrailia, is an intresting lizard that has a HUGE "frill" around it's neck which is used to intimidate predotors by making itself look bigger than it already is. This lizard is nicknamed the bicycle lizard, because it can run on it's hind feet by moving it's leg in a circular motion as if it were pushing bicycle pedals! </h2>

    <h2 id="text4" > The Basilisk Lizard is commonly known for an amazing ability, the ability to run on water! It's native to Central and South America around ponds in that area. How do they run on water you ask? Their toes spread out and fringes of skin unfold between the toes to increase the surface area of their feet. They slap the water with their feet HARD so that the lizard jumps up in to the air. <h2>
